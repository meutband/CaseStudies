# Premise

You are a contract data scientist/consultant hired by a new e-commerce site to try to weed out fraudsters. The company unfortunately does not have much data science expertise... so you must properly scope and present your solution to the manager before you embark on your analysis. Also, you will need to build a sustainable software project that you can hand off to the companies engineers by deploying your model in the cloud. Since others will potentially use/extend your code you NEED to properly encapsulate your code and leave plenty of comments.

# Side notes

The instructors set up a server that sent out a single event on a json file every 10 seconds. We connected our laptops to the server to get us data to test and put into the table.
