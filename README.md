Case Studies that I worked as part of the Galvanize Data Science Immersive Program.

### Regression Case Study

The goal of the contest is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment at auction based on it's usage, equipment type, and configuration. The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.

### Machine Learning Case Study

The problem is churn prediction with a ride-sharing company in San Francisco. 

### Recommender Case Study

Today you are going to have a little friendly competition with your classmates. You are going to building a recommendation system based off data from the Jester Dataset. It includes user ratings of over 100 jokes.

### Fraud Detection Case Study

You are a contract data scientist/consultant hired by a new e-commerce site to try to weed out fraudsters. The company unfortunately does not have much data science expertise... so you must properly scope and present your solution to the manager before you embark on your analysis. Also, you will need to build a sustainable software project that you can hand off to the companies engineers by deploying your model in the cloud. Since others will potentially use/extend your code you NEED to properly encapsulate your code and leave plenty of comments.
